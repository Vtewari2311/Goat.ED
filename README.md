The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model using data-driven approached to predict the outcome of an MMA fight, and utilize results to predict the best fighters in an individual sport such as MMA. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical MMA matches, including information on the fighters' stats, such as their record, reach, and height, as well as information on the bout, such as the date, venue, and judges.

The model will use this information to make predictions on the outcome of future matches. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a useful tool for boxing fans and experts, as well as to advance our understanding of the factors that contribute to the outcome of a boxing match.

The project will be open-sourced on Github and released under a permissive open-source license to encourage collaboration and contributions from the community. The code, documentation, and results of the project will be available for anyone with restrictive use, modification or build upon. We believe that this project has the potential to make a real impact in the world of boxing and we are excited to see what the community will do with it.
